      <h2>Dinosaurs</h2>
      <p>This is a website dedicated to some popular species of dinosaurs. </p>
      <p> Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles[note 1] of the clade Dinosauria. They first appeared during the
        Triassic period, between 245 and 233.23 million years ago (mya), although the exact origin and timing of the
        evolution of dinosaurs is a subject of active research. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after
        the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201.3 mya and their dominance continued throughout the Jurassic and
        Cretaceous periods. The fossil record shows that birds are feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier
        theropods during the Late Jurassic epoch, and are the only dinosaur lineage known to have survived the
        Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event approximately 66 mya. Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian
        dinosaurs—birds—and the extinct non-avian dinosaurs, which are all dinosaurs other than birds.</p>
      <p> Dinosaurs are varied from taxonomic, morphological and ecological standpoints. Birds, at over 10,700 living
        species, are among the most diverse groups of vertebrates. Using fossil evidence, paleontologists have
        identified over 900 distinct genera and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs. Dinosaurs
        are represented on every continent by both extant species (birds) and fossil remains. Through the first half
        of the 20th century, before birds were recognized as dinosaurs, most of the scientific community believed
        dinosaurs to have been sluggish and cold-blooded. Most research conducted since the 1970s, however, has
        indicated that dinosaurs were active animals with elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social
        interaction. Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Evidence suggests that all dinosaurs were egg-laying,
        and that nest-building was a trait shared by many dinosaurs, both avian and non-avian.</p>
      <p>


        The first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early 19th century, with the name "dinosaur" (meaning
        "terrible lizard") being coined by Sir Richard Owen in 1842 to refer to these "great fossil lizards".[7][8][9]
        Since then, mounted fossil dinosaur skeletons have been major attractions at museums worldwide, and dinosaurs
        have become an enduring part of popular culture. The large sizes of some dinosaurs, as well as their seemingly
        monstrous and fantastic nature, have ensured their regular appearance in best-selling books and films, such as
        Jurassic Park. Persistent public enthusiasm for the animals has resulted in significant funding for dinosaur
        science, and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media.
