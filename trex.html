        <h2>Tyrannosaurus</h2>

        <p>Tyrannosaurus is a genus of large theropod dinosaur. The species Tyrannosaurus rex (rex meaning "king" in
          Latin), often called T. rex or colloquially T-Rex, is one of the best represented theropods. It lived
          throughout what is now western North America, on what was then an island continent known as Laramidia.
          Tyrannosaurus had a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids. Fossils are found in a variety of rock
          formations dating to the Maastrichtian age of the Upper Cretaceous period, 68 to 66 million years ago. It was
          the last known member of the tyrannosaurids and among the last non-avian dinosaurs to exist before the
          Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.</p>
        <p>
          Like other tyrannosaurids, Tyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a long,
          heavy tail. Relative to its large and powerful hind limbs, the forelimbs of Tyrannosaurus were short but
          unusually powerful for their size, and they had two clawed digits. The most complete specimen measures up to
          12.3–12.4 m (40–41 ft) in length, but according to most modern estimates, Tyrannosaurus could have exceeded
          sizes of 12.4 m (41 ft) in length, 4 m (13 ft) in height, and 10 tonnes (9.8 long tons; 11 short tons) in
          mass. Although many other theropods likely rivaled Tyrannosaurus in size, it is still among the largest known
          land predators and is estimated to have exerted the strongest bite force among all terrestrial animals. By far
          the largest carnivore in its environment, Tyrannosaurus rex was most likely an apex predator, preying upon
          hadrosaurs, juvenile armored herbivores like ceratopsians and ankylosaurs, and possibly sauropods. Some
          experts have suggested the dinosaur was primarily a scavenger. The question of whether Tyrannosaurus was an
          apex predator or a pure scavenger was among the longest debates in paleontology. Most paleontologists today
          accept that Tyrannosaurus was both an active predator and a scavenger.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          As the archetypal theropod, Tyrannosaurus has been one of the best-known dinosaurs since the early 20th
          century and has been featured in film, advertising, postal stamps, and many other media.
