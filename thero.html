        <h2>Therizinosaurus</h2>

        <p>Therizinosaurus (meaning 'scythe lizard') is a genus of very large therizinosaurid that lived in Asia during
          the Late Cretaceous period in what is now the Nemegt Formation around 70 million years ago. It contains a
          single species, Therizinosaurus cheloniformis. The first remains of Therizinosaurus were found in 1948 by a
          Mongolian field expedition at the Gobi Desert and later described by Evgeny Maleev in 1954. The genus is only
          known from a few bones, including gigantic manual unguals (claw bones), from which it gets its name, and
          additional findings comprising fore and hindlimb elements that were discovered from the 1960s through the
          1980s.</p>
        <p>
          Therizinosaurus was a colossal therizinosaurid that could grow up to 9–10 m (30–33 ft) long and 4–5 m (13–16
          ft) tall, and weigh possibly over 5 t (5.5 short tons). Like other therizinosaurids, it would have been a
          slow-moving, long-necked, high browser equipped with a rhamphotheca (horny beak) and a wide torso for food
          processing. Its forelimbs were particularly robust and had three fingers that bore unguals which, unlike other
          relatives, were very stiffened, elongated, and only had significant curvatures at the tips. Therizinosaurus
          had the longest known manual unguals of any land animal, reaching above 50 cm (20 in) in length. Its hindlimbs
          ended in four functionally weight-bearing toes differing from other theropod groups in which the first toe was
          reduced to a dewclaw and also resembling the very distantly related sauropodomorphs.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was one of the last and the largest representative of its unique group, the Therizinosauria (formerly known
          as Segnosauria; the segnosaurs). During and after its original description in 1954, Therizinosaurus had rather
          complex relationships due to the lack of complete specimens and relatives at the time. Maleev thought the
          remains of Therizinosaurus to belong to a large turtle-like reptile, and also named a separate family for the
          genus: Therizinosauridae. Later on, with the discovery of more complete relatives, Therizinosaurus and kin
          were thought to represent some kind of Late Cretaceous sauropodomorphs or transitional ornithischians, even
          though at some point it was suggested that it may have been a theropod. After years of taxonomic debate,
          nevertheless, they are now placed in one of the major dinosaur clades, Theropoda, specifically as
          maniraptorans. Therizinosaurus is widely recovered within Therizinosauridae by most analyses.
